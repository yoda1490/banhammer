Based on http://www.byteme.org.uk/2014/04/21/ban-hammer-fail2ban-geo-ip-on-google-maps/


rjkreider updated this to work with PHP7.x, fixed the GeoIP Legacy updater and include the modified fail2sql

I've updated this to work with OpenStreetMap as Google now ask credit card to use their API. 
I Also added some libs like Jquery/Bootstrap to improve the style and make it compatible with smartphones
Also implemented a country layer and colorized them regarding the number of attacks
